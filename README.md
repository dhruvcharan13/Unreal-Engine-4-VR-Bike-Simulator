# Unreal-Engine-4-VR-Bike-Simulator
Welcome to the VR Simulator project, a cutting-edge virtual reality experience developed in Unreal Engine 4.27. This project seamlessly integrates the functionality of two ESP32 microcontroller chips, enabling bidirectional communication between the virtual world and external devices.

## Getting Started

This repository contains all the necessary files and resources to compile and run the simulator within Unreal Engine 4.27. While it might be compatible with other Unreal Engine versions, thorough testing has been limited to version 4.27.

## Project Origin

This VR simulator was conceived and created as part of my internship at NITK, Surathkal. It serves as a testament to the practical applications of virtual reality technology.

## Installing the solution:

1. Download Unreal Engine from www.unrealengine.com.

2. Install Unreal Engine with version 4.27

3. Get a copy of the projectâ€™s code. Either from the included zip file or from GitHub.

4. Launch the VRsimulator.uproject file. This will compile the project and open it in Unreal Engine.

5. Download the ArduinoIDE files.

## Using the solution:

### Wireless communication

1. Set up a mosquitto server.

2. Get the IP configuration from CMD.

### ESP32

1. Connect your first ESP32 to a KY-040 encoder at pins 4 and 5.

2. Connect your first ESP32 to a potentiometer at pin 34 too.

3. Connect your second ESP32 to a servo motor at pin 18.

4. Make changes to the SSID, password and MQTT address of the code to your specifications

5. Upload the cycle_input code to the first ESP32.

6. Upload the cycle_servo code to the second ESP32.

### Unreal Engine 4

1. Run VRsimulator.uproject.

2. Make changes to the IP address in the blueprint of the pawn Vehicle Blueprint.

3. Connect the VR headset to the PC running UE4.

4. Play the simulation in VR preview mode.


## Controlling the simulator

1. Use the potentiometer to steer left and right.

2. Rotate the encoder to control the speed of the bicycle.

3. The servo will move in respect to the rotation of the bicycle model in Unreal Engine 4.
